# Apk Decompiler
One afternoon, I got a scam message (I really miss you, Kerry from Ballarat) and it gave me an apk (probably a tracker). I didn't have a laptop and wanted to decompile it, but I could not. So this was born

# THANKS!!!
Thanks skylot and all Jadx Contributors (https://github.com/skylot/jadx), for making a beautiful decompiler and keeping it open source.

# Building
Use android studio and just accept all the gradle changes and shit like that. 

# Usage
Once it's built, it will open a menu. if you want to decompile from a list of currently installed applications just click "Select APK from Apps" and it will bring up a menu after a bit. If it's from a file, click "Select APK from File" and navigate to the files location.

# Complaints?
Unless it's a major problem with the application, i'm not doing anything else with this. I've spent 2 months on this (some of the time procrastinating) and just want to be through with it. Also, there may be some profanity somewhere in the source code, all written in the midst of anger and frustration.
