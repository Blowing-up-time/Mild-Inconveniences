# Folder Skeleton Generator
Basically i needed to re-order my folders, but that's boring so i pulled this out of my ass.
in my opinion the coding is some of the best i've done, probably a few things here and there i could touch up a bit (the variable fds for example)
anyways enjoy

# Usage
FSG --file <filename> <br />
the file you are targetting should be structured like a tree, the parent should be at the top, blah blah blah i cant describe it myself so please go look at the example i left there
