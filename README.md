# Mild-Inconveniences

I get mildly inconvenienced quite a bit. And i hate it. So instead of dealing with it, i usually break out my terrible coding skills and try to make it a little bit faster. i try my best to make sure these aren't helpful to society in any way, but sometimes they are. There will be updates, but only when i get Mildly Inconvenienced, which is more often when you think. Epic.

# Notice
I'm a "pull it out of my ass" kind of guy. i doon't bug test my programs often, so using them outside of the defined intentions can lead to some weird results. if i uninstall your antivirus accidently, it's most likely your fault since you disobeyed my clear instructions to not run it in the antiviruses folder. if there is an actual error that is related to the basic functionality of the program, then make an issue. thanks for reading this. also i have no regard for speliing but i have some regard for grammar so my sentences are structured like a harvard professor and spelt like a 3 year old
